  <h1>How to Make and Host a Free Gallery or Artist's Website</h1>
  <p>
    A printable digital zine designed to help artists with absolutely no programming or website building experience
    make, host and maintain their own personal portfolio websites.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <img src="images/happy-desk.jpg" alt="">
  <br>
  <p>
    Why make your own website? Maybe you don't want to pay for SquareSpace, maybe you don't like Instagram's algorithm,
    maybe you just want to have more direct control over how your work looks online, maybe you just want to know how to
    make your own website and check out a little light programming.
  </p>
  <p>In any case it's a fun empowering project to take on!</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Step One: Make a GitHub Account</h2>
  <p>
    What's GitHub? It's a free platform for hosting collaborative programming projects that's used by almost every
    modern programmer and web developer. They also offer free website hosting to showcase projects, which we can use to
    host our artist's website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just go to <a href="http://www.github.com">http://www.github.com</a> and create a new account!
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Step Two: Create a New Project</h2>
  <p>
    In GitHub speak, we call projects <b>reposatories</b>. Look around for the link to <b>create a new reposatory</b>
    and give it a click. You'll be asked to create a name, which could just be your name or <b>"portfolio-website"</b>,
    just use dashes instead of spaces. Regardless the name is totally up to you!
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Step Three: Make a New File</h2>
  <p>
    Find and click the link to <b>create a new file</b>. You'll want to name it <b>index.html</b>. Basically this tells
    the computer that it should display this as a webpage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now paste the following in the new file:
  </p>

  <div class="code">
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt; <br>
    <br>
    &lt;head&gt; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;<b>Your Name Here</b>&lt;/title&gt; <br>
    &lt;/head&gt; <br>
    <br>
    &lt;body&gt; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <b>Welcome to my Portfolio Website!</b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
    &lt;/body&gt; <br>
    <br>
    &lt;/html&gt; <br>
  </div>

  <p>
    This is HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), it's hideous because it was invented in the early 1990's! But the good
    news is that it's simple once you get used to looking at it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of HTML is to tell web browsers how to format text, images etc. For instance when we see
    <b>&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my Portfolio Website!&lt;/h1&gt;</b> the <b>h1</b> tells a web browser that we want this
    text to be formatted as a title. We call these things <b>html tags</b> or in this case an <b>h1 tag</b>.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <img src="images/happy-disks.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>
    Step Four: Save the File!
  </h2>
  <p>
    When we want to save changes to a file on GitHub, we do something called <b>committing</b>. Just think of it as
    committing the changes you've made to a file or a bunch of files.
  </p>
  <p>
    Down towards the bottom of the page click the button that says <b>Commit changes</b> or <b>Commit new file</b>. This
    will save everything you've done!
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>
    Step Five: Bring it to Life!
  </h2>
  <p>
    Now let's make this a real life website! Go to the <b>settings</b> section of your project and find the <b>GitHub
      Pages</b> section down towards the bottom. Now click the dropdown that says <b>none</b> and select <b>master</b>. Then click save to the right. When the page reloads if you scroll back down to that
    section there should be a live clickable link.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you try to click this link right now you might get a dead page, it might take a little while after first turning
    this on. The internet pipes can be slow and creaky. But after a few minutes it should work and now any committed
    updates you make should be pretty close to instantaneous.
  </p>
  <img src="images/network.jpg" alt="">
  <p>
    In any case, congratulations! This is now your personal website! Anyone on the internet can access this url and it
    will update any time you save (commit) new images and text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course you probably want to use a custom url like <b>www.yourname.com</b>, that's a seperate process but don't
    worry it's pretty simple and you can do it after you finish your website.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can always find the link address to your website here in the settings, but you might want to copy it and keep it somewhere just to save yourself the time.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>
    Step Six: Add an Image File!
  </h2>
  <p>
    Now click around until you get back to the root page for our project (reposatory) where we can see a link to our
    <b>index.html</b> file that we created a while ago.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Once we're here you should see a dropdown button that says <b>Add file</b>. Select the <b>upload files</b> option
    and upload an image from your computer. Now click <b>choose your file</b> and select a picture file from your
    computer. Any picture will do, this can just a place holder that you'll probably change later.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the file is done uploading click the <b>Commit changes</b> button again.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>
    Step Seven: Add the Image to Your Website!
  </h2>
  <p>
    Now let's add a reference to that image to your actual website so it appears with your text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Go back to the main page for your project, you should be able to click your <b>index.html</b> file. After doing this you should be able to see all the HTML we pasted in there before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Find and click the <b>pencil icon</b>, this will allow you to edit the HTML file and should be towards the top right of the area where the HTML appears.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now you should be able to edit all this HTML freely. Update your <b>index.html</b> file so that it includes a <b>&lt;img src="<b>your-files-name.jpg</b>"&gt</b> line that looks like this:
  </p>

  <div class="code">
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; <br>
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt; <br>
    <br>
    &lt;head&gt; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;<b>Your Name Here</b>&lt;/title&gt; <br>
    &lt;/head&gt; <br>
    <br>
    &lt;style&gt; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; img { <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; width: 500px; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } <br>
    &lt;/style&gt; <br>
    <br>
    &lt;body&gt; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Welcome to my Portfolio Website!</b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="<b>your-files-name.jpg</b>"&gt; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Untitled Image, acrylic on canvas, 2020.</b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; <br>
    &lt;/body&gt; <br>
    <br>
    &lt;/html&gt; <br>
  </div>

  <p>
    In the <b>&lt;img src="your-files-name.jpg"&gt;</b> make sure the full image file name in the quote matches how the file name appears on GitHub, including the <b>.jpg</b> which might be <b>.png</b> or something else depending on the file you uploaded. The <b>&lt;style&gt;</b> section we've added is for controlling the style of our text, images etc. In this case we're doing just what it looks like we're doing, making all our images 500 pixels wide. This is referred to as CSS rather than HTML, but we'll get into that more later.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> is referred to as an <b>image tag</b> with <b>src</b> being short for <b>image source</b>. The <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> is referred to as a <b>paragraph tag</b>, which translates to regular sized text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now confirm that it's working ok by loading your website's link in another tab. You might have to wait a minute or two and reload the page a couple times before the site updates. Remember you can always find your website link again under the <b>GitHub Pages</b> section under <b>Settings</b>.
  </p>
