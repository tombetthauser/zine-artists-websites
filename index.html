  <h1>How to Make and Host a Free Artist's Website</h1>
  <p>
    A printable digital zine designed to help artists with absolutely no programming or website building experience make, host and maintain their own personal portfolio websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why make your own website? Maybe you don't want to pay for SquareSpace, maybe you don't like Instagram's algorithm, maybe you just want to have more direct control over how your work looks online, maybe you just want to know how to make your own website and check out a little light programming.
  </p>
  <p>In any case it's a fun empowering project to take on!</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Step One: Make a GitHub Account</h2>
  <p>
    What's GitHub? It's a free platform for hosting collaborative programming projects that's used by almost every modern programmer and web developer. They also offer free website hosting to showcase projects, which we can use to host our artist's website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just go to <a href="http://www.github.com">http://www.github.com</a> and create a new account!
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Step Two: Create a New Project</h2>
  <p>
    In GitHub speak, we call projects <b>reposatories</b>. Look around for the link to <b>create a new reposatory</b> and give it a click. You'll be asked to create a name, which could just be your name or <b>"portfolio-website"</b>, just use dashes instead of spaces. Regardless the name is totally up to you!
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Step Three: Make a New File</h2>
  <p>
    Find and click the link to <b>create a new file</b>. You'll want to name it <b>index.html</b>. Basically this tells the computer that it should display this as a webpage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now inside the file paste the following in the new file:
  </p>

  <div class="code"> 
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;   <br>
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;    <br>
      <br>
    &lt;head&gt;    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;<b>Your Name Here</b>&lt;/title&gt;   <br>
    &lt;/head&gt;   <br>
      <br>
    &lt;body&gt;    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;    <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>Welcome to my Portfolio Website!</b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/h1&gt;   <br>
    &lt;/body&gt;   <br>
      <br>
    &lt;/html&gt;   <br>
  </div>

  <p>
    This is HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), it's hideous because it was invented in the early 1990's! But the good new is that it's simple once you get used to looking at it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of HTML is to tell web browsers how to format text, images etc. For instance when we see <b>&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my Portfolio Website!&lt;/h1&gt;</b> the <b>h1</b> tells a web browser that we want this text to be formatted as a title. We call this things <b>html tags</b> or just <b>tags</b>.
  </p>
</div>

    Step Four: Save the File!
